================>>  BASICS OF PYTHON  <<==================

Python: 
	- Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language,
	- Python is dynamically-typed language,
	- Human understanding language,
	- Guido van Rossum was developed and released  in 1991 as Python,
	- Python 2.0  was released in 2000,
	- Python 3.0 released in 2008,
	- Python is Multi Paradigm(core strength) programming language.

Python Interpreter:
	An interpreter is a kind of program that executes other programs.
 When you write Python programs , it converts source code written by the developer into 
intermediate language which is again translated into the native language / machine language that is executed.

Use of Python:
	> Web Application
	> Mobile Application
	> Games
	> DadaBase
	> Network Programming
	> DataScience/ Machine Learning/ Artificial Intelligence
	> Internet of Things

Features of Python:
	1. Simple ,easy to learn 
	2. Free and Open source
	3. High level language
	4. Platform indepent(PVM)
	5. Portability
	6. Dynamically Typed language
	7. No need to explict data type in python
	8. Libraries - extensive library in python.

Flavours of Python :
	1. python 
	2. pypy - improve performe(IIT compiler)
	3. Jython - (IVM) java python code
	4. Cython/ Cpython - standard
	5. Iron python - c#, .Net support
	6. Puby python
	7. Anaconda python - large set of data processing

python core strength - Projects.

Python "Duck Duck typing"

Immutability:
	once we create an object in python. we can't change it.It we trying to change that a new object will be create inste memory.

Python Operators:
	1. Arithmetic Operator         - (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
	2. Assignment Opreator       - ( = )
	3. Comparision Operator     - (>, <, >=, <=, )
	4. Bitwise Operator              - (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
	5. Logical Operator              - (and, or, not )
	6. Identity Operator 	          - (is, is not)
	7. Membership Operator     - (in, not in)

Controflow Statement: 
	1.  if , elif, else
	2. Nested if
Python is a  "CASE SENSITIVE "language.

Iterative statement:
	1. While loop / Nested While loop 
	2. For loop / Nested For loop
Types of Keyword:
	- continue
	- break
	- pass
